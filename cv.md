## About me

Previously, I worked in various fields from public service to the financial market and real business. I have always been interested in computers. Since 2022, I have become interested in development. I wanted to dive into this topic as much as possible. I got carried away with the frontend, as I am visual by nature.  

I am used to learning from the best, which is why I chose RS School for myself. I set a goal - to become a senior developer.  

At the same time, knowing the need for the English language, I began an active study of it. The task is to learn it at least to B2.  

My strengths are purposefulness, the ability to find a way out of non-standard situations, teamwork. Life experience allows me not to fall, and, in case of occurrence, to resolve conflict situations. I love learning new things.  

My hobbies are sports and cooking.
